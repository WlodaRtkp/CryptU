# CryptU
Hi! Thats my small weekend project which encrypts and decrypts text using vignere cipher. I made two versions one is tkinter app second is flask app. 
Requirements are python3 and Tkinter or flask installed on the system.
The latest version is using Fernet encryption and also I have made an exe from it available on http://tkp.life
